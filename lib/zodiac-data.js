        horoscope: 'Will you go out with me? Be careful if a person says yes when you ask that question today, Aquarius. You could take the nature of this situation to the extreme. Saying yes doesnt mean youre suddenly in charge of his or her life. Nor are you responsible for anything that person does or how they feel. If youre still asking the question without getting any positive responses, dont worry. Keep trying.'

        horoscope: 'You may be trying to get to the end of the road too quickly without really enjoying all the steps along the way, Aries. This is especially true when it comes to any sort of artistic project or romantic partnership that you might be involved in at this time. If you arent savoring every part of your journey, then perhaps this isnt the path you should be on.'

        horoscope: 'There is irony in todays situation, Cancer.The only real remedy for situations like this is to accept them and joke about it.If you try to take yourself too seriously, especially when it comes to art or romance, you will inevitably fail.Your heart is sensual and your emotions profound.Bring yourself into balance by laughing instead of crying about the events of the day.'

        horoscope: ' When it comes to romance, your body is apt to turn to jelly today. You may be so emotional that you cant function, Capricorn.Thats love. And even though it can be heavenly, it can also be debilitating. You could deliberate for hours about an issue because you dont want to make a move without your partners input. If you dont have a romantic partner now, find one soon, but not today.'

        horoscope: 'The hungrier you get, the more determined you will become, Leo. Be careful that your determination doesnt turn into desperation and neediness.Its unattractive and will get you nowhere. Keep on the upward spiral, and let determination turn into inspiration and cooperation. You will find this especially true when it comes to matters of the heart. You have a great deal of power. Put it to good use.'

        horoscope: 'Things may get a bit difficult in your romantic life because of someone in the partnership who isnt necessarily taking a very realistic approach to the situation, Libra.Theres a bit of a power play going on as someone tries to throw their weight around without considering the other persons feelings.Tension is brewing, and youd be wise to deal with it now.'

        horoscope: 'At the end of the day, youre the one who has to look in the mirror and know who you are, Sagittarius.Think about this the next time youre tempted to make a rude comment or spread a displeasing fact about someone else. One side of you may be able to rationalize behavior that the other side simply despises. Today look at both of sides of yourself, not just the one that pleases you.'

        horoscope: 'Your creative juices are flowing freely, Scorpio, but there appears to be a roadblock. Something or someone apparently doesnt want you to continue down the path youre on.
